How can I ensure my code is functional and secure? Writing functional and secure code can be challenging, especially if you're new to it. I ensure my code is both functional and secure by sticking to the requirements and writing extensive tests to achieve high coverage percentages. In one of my programs, I tested repeatedly until the coverage percentage was at least 90%. Ensuring code is functional involves following requirements, while ensuring code is secure involves writing tests based on requirements.

How do I incorporate user needs into a program? I interpret user needs by breaking them down into aspects that will or will not work with the program. For instance, if a requirement is that names cannot be null or longer than 10 characters, I use an if statement to cover both failure options. For more ambiguous requirements, I look more deeply into them. For example, a program I worked on required adding time to two separate clocks with the push of a button. This was broken down extensively to meet the general requirement, but not by creating an illegal argument exception.

How do I approach software design? My current approach to software design involves creating a checklist of requirements by reviewing documents or transcripts from interviews. If applicable, I break the requirements into a list of objects and methods needed to achieve them. I then write the code to meet the requirements, followed by refining it for efficiency. While this method has worked well for me in my studies, I am open to a more expansive and insightful approach to software design.
